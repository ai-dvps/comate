## Steel vendoring

### Vendored Steel
The third-party Steel browser engine, repackaged as a pure-JS, dependency-pruned bundle that ships inside the desktop app's resources; the embedded controlled browser runs it locally instead of requiring Docker.

The bundle is rebuilt from a pinned upstream commit and must pass build-time gates before packaging: a pure-JS audit (no native binaries), a size budget, and a dangling-symlink audit. Opt-in heavyweight or native upstream dependencies are replaced by pure-JS stubs that load cleanly and throw only if actually used.

### Production closure
The set of runtime dependencies vendored alongside the Vendored Steel build product, computed from the pinned upstream lockfile rather than from a full npm install, so dev-only and platform-optional packages never reach the app bundle.
